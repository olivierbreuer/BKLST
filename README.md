# BKLST
As every parent, I m afraid about what my kid can find on the Internet, specially on porn websites. 
I have checked different solutions and after a huge amout on research I have decided to create one myself. 

This list is a complilation of 2 things :
  1. Use of different existing blocking lists found on internet. 
  2. Based on my own applications to grab urls and domains out of different search engines.

I can't guarantee that this list is complete but it is huge enough to protect correctly your home.
This list is auto updated.  

You can use it on a varity of ways beginning with a home file on your laptotp. 
I use it personally with the pi-hole project. 

This list is free for home and personal use only. 
If you need to add or use it on a product you sell please contact me first.

At the end the goal is to automatically generate different lists to be able to auto update different products. 

# The list 

But for now there is one and only one single list : BKLST.txt

Please let me know if you encounter any problem or if you simply use the list !
Any questions ? I will be glad to help.
